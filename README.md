### Data source
The 500 Cities Project was launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and CDC Foundation.
This dataset includes estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). All participants in this survey are 18 years old or older.
We selected 3 unhealthy behaviors, 6 heath outcomes and 1 preventive service for this analysis.

### Overview:
This study utilized data from the 500 Cities Project APIs. These are on-going surveys conducted by the CDC in 500 cities across the US. All participants are 18 years old or older.The primary focus of our study was to explore the association between depression and three unhealthy behaviors: binge drinking, insufficient sleep (less than 7 hours per day), and physical inactivity. We then made a comparison in health outcomes between the top 5 happiest cities and top 5 most depressed cities. We also identified the top 10 least depressed states and bottom 10 most depressed states.

### Analysis:
Mental Health Data: In this survey, participants were asked if their mental health was not good for more than 14 days in the last 30 days. From the map, we can see that cities with higher rates of depression were concentrated along the east coast, some parts of the midwest, and areas near the Pacific Ocean on the west coast. Less-depressed cities were primarily situated in the central region of the map.

Depression vs Binge Drinking: The binge drinking data include participants who report having five or more drinks (for men) or four or more drink (for women) on an occasion in the past 30 days. Cities that have the highest binge drinking population are in the midwest, west coast and cities near the Atlantic ocean. Statistical analysis revealed a weak correlation (r-value: -0.37) between depression and binge drinking, indicating a minimal connection between mental well-being and alcohol consumption habits.

Depression vs Sleeping Behaviour: Participants were asked to report if they usually getting insufficient sleep (less than 7 hours). From the map, we can see that people from the east coast tend to sleep less than people from the west coast. The moderate correlation coefficient (r-value: 0.64) emphasized a notable link between depression and sleep deprivation. The analysis highlighted that cities with higher depression rates also exhibited a higher prevalence of insufficient sleep (less than 7 hours per day).

Depression vs Physical Inactivity: In this survey, participants were asked: "During the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for exercise?" to measure physical inactivity. From the map, we can see that people from the west coast are a lot more active than the east coast. There is a strong correlation (r-value: 0.73) between depression and physical inactivity. This implies that cities with higher depression rates were more likely to have a populace with limited leisure time for physical activities.

The study further examined the top 5 least-depressed cities in the United States. They are: Plymouth, Sunnyvale, Fremont, Johns Creek and San Ramon. The top 5 most depressed cities are: Flint, Reading, Camden, Youngstown, and Detroit. When comparing the 2 groups, we see that people from more depressed cities have much worse health outcomes. Not only do they have worse mental heath, but are also more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease. Their population is also less likely to have health insurance. Policy makers of these cities should find a way to enhance the overall well-being and quality of life of their residents.

### Conclusion:
In summary, our analysis of data from the CDC 500 Cities Project APIs has showed some connection between depression and unhealthy behaviors. Overall there is a weak correlation between depression and binge drinking. However, there are notable connections between depression and insufficient sleep and physical inactivity. Futher investigation also shows that cities with better mental health also has better overanll physical health.
